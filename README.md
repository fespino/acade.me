# acade.me

acade.me is a Progressive Offline-First Web Application with a persistent local database, leveraging Tailwind CSS for styling and integrating GPT-4 to provide users with a seamless learning experience. The application is built using the modern frontend framework Svelte, along with various other cutting-edge technologies. This project is part of an experiment to better understand how to integrate GPT-4 into the development cycle. As a testament to the capabilities of GPT-4, this README file was generated through Chat GPT-4.
